- Learned about `Binary Search Trees` in Java.

## Introduction

- A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure but with the following properties:
  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
  - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

> Special Property

- Inorder transversal of a binary search tree gives a sorted sequence.
- Binary Search Tree makes search efficient & its `Time Complexity is O(h)` where h is the height of the tree.

> Strategy

- Most problems will be solved using `recursion` i.e. by dividing into subproblems & making recursive calls on subproblems.
