`Object Oriented Programming`

- OOPs is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects and their interactions. It is a way to structure code in a way that makes it easier to manage and reuse code.

1. `Classes and Objects` :

- A class is a template for creating objects, which are instances of that class.
- An object is an instance of a class, and it has its own state and behavior.

  Note : Object is "a real world entity" and Class is "a blueprint of a real world entity".

2. `Access Modifiers` :

- Access Modifiers are used to control the accessibility of class members.

- There are four types of access modifiers:
  - `Public` : accessible from anywhere.
  - `Protected` : accessible within the class and its subclasses.
  - `Default` : accessible within the same package.
  - `Private` : accessible only within the class.

3. `Getters and Setters` :

- Getters and Setters are methods that allow you to access and modify the state of an object.
- Getters are used to read the state of an object, while Setters are used to modify the state of an object.

4. `Encapsulation` :

- Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together into a single unit called a class.
- It also implements data hiding.

5. `Constructors` :

- Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created.
- They are used to initialize the state of an object.

- There are three types of constructors:

  - Default Constructor/Non-Parameterized Constructor : called when an object is created without any arguments.
  - Parameterized Constructor : called when an object is created with arguments.
  - Copy Constructor : called when an object is created by copying another object.

  Note: Contructor Overloading is the process of creating multiple constructors with different parameters.

6. `Inheritance` :

- Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that is a subclass of an existing class.
- It allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.

- There are four types of inheritance:

  - Single Level Inheritance
  - Multilevel Inheritance
  - Hierarchical Inheritance
  - Hybrid Inheritance

7. `Polymorphism` :

- Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms.
- It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types.

- There are two types of polymorphism:

  - `Compile Time Polymorphism` (Static Polymorphism or Method Overloading)

    - In this type of polymorphism, we can create multiple methods with the same name but different types of parameters or different number of parameters.

  - `Run Time Polymorphism` (Dynamic Polymorphism or Method Overriding)

    - In this type of polymorphism, we can create multiple methods with the same name in both the base class and the derived class, but when we call the method, the method of the derived class will be executed.

8. `Abstraction` :

- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the user.
- It allows you to create a simplified view of a complex system.

9. `Interface` :

- An interface is a contract that specifies the behavior of a class.
- It allows you to define a set of methods that must be implemented by a class.
- It is a way to achieve abstraction.
- It is fifth type of inheritance ( Multiple Inheritance ).
