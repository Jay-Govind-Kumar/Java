- Learned about `Greedy Algorithm` in Java.

## Introduction

- Greedy algorithm is a technique used to solve a problem by making the locally optimal choice at each step & hope to achieve the globally optimal solution.
- In a greedy algorithm, the choice made at each step is the best possible choice.

## Pros & Cons

- `Pros`

  - Easy to implement
  - Easy to understand
  - Good enough performance (Time Complexity)

- `Cons`

  - May not always give the globally optimal solution

## Applications of Greedy Algorithm

- Activity Selection Problem
- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Job Sequencing Problem
- Chocola Problem
- Coin Change Problem
