- Learned about `Divide & Conquer` in Java.

# Introduction

- Divide and conquer is a divide and conquer algorithm that is used to divide a problem into smaller subproblems and then solve them recursively.

## Merge Sort

- In Merge Sort, we divide the array into two halves, sort them recursively and merge them to get the sorted array.
- time complexity - `O(nlogn)`
- space complexity - `O(n)`
- technique - `depth first search`

## Quick Sort

- In Quick Sort, we divide the array into two parts, one part is less than the pivot element and the other part is greater than the pivot element.
- space complexity - `O(logn)`
- time complexity - `O(nlogn)`
- Worst case time complexity - `O(n^2)`
- In worst case, the pivot element is the smallest or largest element of the array.
