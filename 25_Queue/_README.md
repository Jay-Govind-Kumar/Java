- Learned about `Queue` in Java.
- Learned about `Deque` in Java.

## Introduction 📖

- A queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is `First In First Out` (FIFO).
- In a queue, the first element that is inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed.

### Implementation

- In Java, Queue is implemented using `java.util.Queue` interface.
- It is a part of the Java Collections Framework.

## Operations on Queue

- `add` : adds an element to the end of the queue. And also known as 'enqueue'.
- `remove` : removes the first element from the queue. And also known as 'dequeue'.
- `peek` : returns the first element from the queue.
- `isEmpty` : checks if the queue is empty.
