- Learned about `Time & Space Complexity` in Java.

# Time Complexity

- Time complexity is the amount of time required to execute a program. It is a measure of the efficiency of a program. It is measured in terms of the number of operations performed by the program.

# Space Complexity

- Space complexity is the amount of space required to store the program. It is a measure of the memory usage of a program. It is measured in terms of the number of variables used by the program.

## Big O Notation

- Big O notation is a notation used to describe the worst time complexity of a program. It is used to describe the time complexity of a program in terms of the number of operations performed by the program.

## Big Omega Notation

- Big omega notation is used to describe the best time complexity of a program.

## Big Thetha Notation

- Big theta notation is used to describe the average time complexity of a program.

### Common Time Complexities

- `O(1)` - Constant Time Complexity
- `O(log n)` - Logarithmic Time Complexity
- `O(n)` - Linear Time Complexity
- `O(n log n)` - Linearithmic Time Complexity
- `O(n^2)` - Quadratic Time Complexity
- `O(n^3)` - Cubic Time Complexity
- `O(2^n)` - Exponential Time Complexity
